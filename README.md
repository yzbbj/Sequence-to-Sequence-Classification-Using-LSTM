# Sequence-to-Sequence-Classification-Using-LSTM
To find out when was the time that the fault occurs and make predictions to find out early faults,you can use a LSTM network to classify each time step of sequence data

You should run the file called 'LSTM.m' to train the network.The you can run the file called 'plott.m' to Compare the predicted labels with actual labels of the test data
